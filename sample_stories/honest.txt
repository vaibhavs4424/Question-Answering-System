A poor woodcutter accidentally dropped his axe into a river .
 He was very upset because he had no money to buy another axe .
As he stood by the river , feeling very sad and not knowing what to do , a fairy appeared .
She stood in the river holding out a golden axe to him . 
" Perhaps this is your axe . I found it in the river , " she said .
" That's not mine , " said the woodcutter .
The fairy then brought out a silver axe .
The woodcutter disowned this one too .
Finally , the fairy held out an axe with a wooden handle .
" That's mine , " said the woodcutter , smiling with happiness .
" Thank you for getting my axe back for me! " said the woodcutter .
" Such honesty deserves a reward , "  said the fairy
She gave the honest woodcutter all the three axes .
