Once when a Lion was asleep , a little Mouse began running up and down upon him . 
This soon wakened the Lion , who placed his huge paw upon him and opened his big jaws to swallow him .
" Pardon , O King ! " cried the little Mouse , " Forgive me this time . I shall never forget your kindness . "
The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him , that he lifted up his paw and let him go .
Sometime later few hunters captured the King and tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on .
Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by and seeing lion sad , ran up to him and bit the ropes that bound the lion .  " Was I not right ? " said the little Mouse , very happy to help the Lion .
