The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals .
" I have never yet been beaten , " said the hare , " when I put forth my full speed . I challenge any one to race with me . "
The Tortoise said quietly , " I accept your challenge . "
" That is a good joke , " said the Hare ; " I could dance round you all the way . "
" Keep your boasting till you've beaten , " answered the Tortoise . " Shall we race ? "
So a course was fixed and a start was made .
The Hare darted almost out of sight at once .
But soon stopped and to show his contempt for the Tortoise , lay down to have a nap .
The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on .
When the Hare awoke from his nap , he saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post .
But hare could not run up in time to save the race .
