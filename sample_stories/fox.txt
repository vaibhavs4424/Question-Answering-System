One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard .
Till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch .
" Just the thing to quench my thirst , " said the fox .
Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump , and just missed the bunch .
Turning round again with a One , Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success .
Again and again he tried but at last had to give it up
And walked away with his nose in the air .
And the fox said " I am sure they are sour . "
